/// High-level overview
/// - We use a Harness that exposes mint/burn to an owner (the handler) for testing.
/// - We use a Handler as the single "system under test" entry point. Foundry's
///   invariant engine will randomly sequence calls to its public functions
///   (approve, transfer, transferFrom, mint, burn) to explore state space.
/// - Invariant: The sum of balances we track (owner + actors) must always equal totalSupply.
///   This is the conservation law for ERC20 under mint/burn/transfer.
///
/// Important: The invariant assumes a "closed world": tokens must not escape the set
/// {owner + actors}. If you add a function that transfers to any other address, also add
/// that address to the tracked set in getSumBalances() or the invariant will (correctly)
/// report a failure due to untracked balances.
